# Support-Vector-Regression

This is an implementation of Support Vector Regression and hence the regression model here is fit to a dataset which 
consists salaries of different Positions of an Employee.

We predict here, the salary of an Employee who is in the 6.5th position of this Employee hierachy. 
Considering that the interview panel is interviewing a candidate and the candidate claims his previous salary when
he was inthe 6.5th position was $160,000.

With this model, we check whether the candidate is honest or is bluffing about his salary.
